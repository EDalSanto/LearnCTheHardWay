# Learn C The Hard Way

### Overview
* book not really about learning C
  * become better defensive programmer
  * understand legacy code

### The Undefined Behaviorists
* ways to write C for which compiler can disregard what's written
  * example: NUL Byte Overruns

### C Compilation Process
* Preprocessing -> analyzes preprocessor commands, lines starting with #, are macros which form own language
  * practically -> inlines libraries, i.e., <stdio.h>
* Compilation (name is confusing) -> C code to assembly specific to target processor architecture
  * allows for C programs to contain inline assembly instructions
  * some C compilers include integrated assemblers avoiding the need to invoke an assembler and this intermediate stage
* Assembly -> assembler used to translate the assembly to machine code (also known as object code)
* Linking -> rearrange machine code
  * linker -> arranges pieces of machine code so that functions in some pieces can call functions in other pieces
    * merges various modules from source files
  * final stage -> produces single executable file

### Make
* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) -> controls the genereation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files
  * Makefile -> tells make how to compile and link a program
  * enables end user to build and install package without knowing details
  * not limited to particular language (or even programming for that matter)
  * Rules and Targets
    * rule -> how to execute a series of commands to build a target file from source files
      * specifies list of dependencies of the target file
      * target -> usually the name of a file generated by the program
      * prerequisite -> fiel that is used as input to create target
      * recipe -> action that make carries out
        * may have more than 1 command
    * can specify which targets to update; otherwise, Make will update first target
  * How Make Works -> declare dependencies and then describe how to build them or rely on the program's internal knowledge of how to build most common software
    * recompilation -> done if the source file, or any header files named as pre-reqs, is more than recent than the object file, or if the object file does not exist
      * sidenote -> linkage takes care of name resolution in C
        * whether two or more declarations for that name are valid

* sidenote / reminder: can pass ENV variables before running a command and they will be set accordingly only during that command
